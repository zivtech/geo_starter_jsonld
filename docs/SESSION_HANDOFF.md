# Session Handoff — hoursAvailable via office_hours (2026-06-02)

Internal working note. Status: **feature COMPLETE + fully validated, UNCOMMITTED in
both repos, awaiting release approval.** Plan + rationale:
`docs/plans/2026-06-02-hoursavailable-via-office-hours.md`.

## What was built

Service JSON-LD now emits `hoursAvailable` (`OpeningHoursSpecification`) from a
structured `drupal/office_hours` field that replaces the free-text string on the
`section_contact_panel` paragraph. Spans two repos:

- **Recipe (`drupal/geo_starter`):** `composer.json` (+`drupal/office_hours: ^1.29`),
  `recipe.yml` (+`office_hours` install), `field_section_hours` storage `string`→
  `office_hours` (cardinality `1`→`-1`), field instance, form display
  (`office_hours_default` widget), view display (`office_hours_table` formatter =
  the parity surface), and the sample contact-panel content (Mon-Fri 09:00-17:00).
  Field settings were lifted from a REAL office_hours export, not fabricated.
- **Module (`drupal/geo_starter_jsonld`):** new pure `src/OpeningHoursMapper.php`
  (+ Unit test), `JsonLdFieldTrait::organizationContactFromSections()` reads the
  office_hours columns defensively (NO runtime dep — office_hours is `require-dev`
  only), `ServiceNormalizer` places hours on `ContactPoint.hoursAvailable` (primary)
  or `Service.hoursAvailable` (fallback when no phone/email), new Kernel
  integration test, updated probe + README + SCHEMA-VALIDATION + `.cspell.json`.

## Key office_hours facts (verified on a real field)
- Stored row: `{day: 0-6 (0=Sunday), starthours/endhours: int HHMM, all_day, comment}`.
- A midnight CLOSE is stored as `endhours = 0` (HTML renders "24:00"); overnight is
  `endhours < starthours`. The mapper normalizes a `0` close to end-of-day (→`23:59`,
  parity-safe vs. "24:00") and DROPS overnight slots; a midnight OPEN (`starthours 0`)
  stays `00:00`. (This was the drupal-critic MUST-FIX — see below.)
- `default_content` imports the multi-column rows natively (no install hook needed).

## Validation (all green)
- phpcs (Drupal+DrupalPractice) 0/0 · phpstan (level 1, drupal-aware) No errors ·
  PHPUnit Unit+Kernel 58 tests/268 assertions exit 0 (the 11 "deprecations" are
  office_hours' own indirect ones, non-fatal).
- `tools/jsonld-probe.php` 23/23 · `tools/schema-domain-check.py` 0 errors/0 warnings
  across all 21 published nodes · live HTML renders the office_hours table (parity:
  JSON-LD ⊆ HTML — closed weekends shown in HTML, omitted from JSON-LD).
- cspell not run locally (node tool); needed words added — verify job-level on push.

## drupal-critic: REVISE → resolved
Two MUST-FIX, both fixed + re-validated: (1) the midnight-close/overnight mapper bug
above (silent wrong window; my 9-5 sample never hit it — the critic fed the real
inputs); (2) phpcs ERRORs (test method names + a doc-comment). Unit cases are now
pinned to the real stored shapes.

## Release plan (NOT yet done — needs approval)
Order is **MODULE first, then RECIPE** (module change is backward-compatible: old
string field → mapper sees no `day`/`starthours` keys → returns `[]` → no-op).
1. **Module → `1.0.0-alpha3`** (current `1.0.0-alpha2`, HEAD was `a3d8418`): commit,
   tag, push `origin` + `drupalcode` together, create d.o. release node, **verify
   job-level CI green** (phpcs/phpstan/cspell are `allow_failure` — check the JOB,
   not the badge).
2. **Recipe → `1.0.0-alpha3`** (current `1.0.0-alpha2`): commit, tag, push both
   remotes, d.o. release node. **Release notes MUST state:** the
   `field_section_hours` string→office_hours change is not an in-place migration —
   fresh installs only; existing alpha2 sites re-applying need the field recreated.
